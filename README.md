# PeerJS-Gossip
PeerJS-Gossip is a gossip library on the top of PeerJS (this project offers the Peer object to enrich
web browsers with peer-to-peer communication capabilities through the WebRTC API). The objective of this 
gossip library is to provide a communication layer that operates through the implementation and management
of gossip-based protocols. Thanks to PeerJS-Gossip, users can enrich their applications with the benefits 
(and constrains) of a P2P-gossip communication layer.
